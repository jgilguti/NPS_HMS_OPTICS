How to use fit_opt_matrix.C

nSettings - number of runs to optimize over
fileID - the end tag on root files, etc
max foils - for us, it should be 2, this is max on a given target
max Del - our range is +/-10%

lines 30-33: enter run numbers (number of lines here should correspond to nSettings)

line 42:  name of the new matrix elements this script outputs
line 43: name of matrix elements this script reads in

nfit: starting int
nfit_max:this is just max hits on 1 foil x total # of foils
npar_final=0 //not sure, don't change
max_order=6 //don't change

Int_t MaxPerBin=1000; //Max number per sieve hole per delta slice..
Int_t MmaxZtarPerBin=15000; // this is max # events per foil

lines 50-70  //define a bunch of histos,
lines 74-200 //create arrays of variables
lines 202-206 //calc center of sieve holes

lines 209-265 //optics file information, ztar_foil array

line 323 Max_Per_Run_Per_Foil = 10500; //this number should be edited to balance the foil contributions

the rest?
calculate stuff

output: a .dat file of 5 columns, first row is zeroth order elements (offsets), 4th column is unchanged delta coefficients from the old matrix.
